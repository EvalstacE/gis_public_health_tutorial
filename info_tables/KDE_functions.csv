Kernel,Best for Data Distributions,Weighting Pattern,Smoothing,Computational Cost,Best for...
Uniform (Rectangular),Only works well for uniformly distributed data. Not suitable for skewed or clustered data.,Equal weight within range,None (sharp edges),Very low,"Simple, fast estimation"
Triangular,Works well for moderately skewed distributions. Can overemphasize tails if data is heavily skewed.,Linearly decreasing,Low,Low,Quick estimates with some smoothing
Quadratic (Biweight),Handles unimodal distributions well. Not ideal for highly skewed data but does better than uniform.,"Parabolic, stronger near center",Medium,Medium,"Small datasets, moderate smoothing"
Gaussian (Normal),Best for normally distributed or near-normal data. Struggles with extreme skew or heavy-tailed distributions.,Exponentially decreasing,High,High,"Most common, very smooth, large datasets"
Cosine,"Works well for moderate skew, not ideal for long-tailed distributions.",Cosine-shaped drop-off,Medium,Medium,Balancing smoothness & efficiency
Epanechnikov,Performs well in moderate skew but not optimal for highly skewed or heavy-tailed data.,"Parabolic, compact support",High (optimal),Low,Theoretically best efficiency
