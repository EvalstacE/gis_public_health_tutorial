Aspect,Local,Geocentric
Definition,"Aligns ellipsoid closely with geoid in a specific region, ensuring high accuracy locally.","Aligns ellipsoid with Earth's center of gravity, providing global consistency."
Accuracy,High accuracy within the specific region; lower accuracy elsewhere.,"Consistent accuracy globally, but less precise for regional details."
Ellipsoid Alignment,"Optimized for regional geoid features, providing precise local measurements.","Centered on Earth's mass and gravity, less specific to regional features."
Scale of Maps,"Critical for large-scale maps with high detail, covering smaller areas.",Best suited for small-scale maps covering larger geographic areas.
Use Cases,"Regional mapping, land surveys, city planning, and infrastructure development.","Global navigation (e.g., GPS), international mapping, and satellite data applications."
Examples,"NAD27, NAD83",WGS84
