Feature,Raster,Vector
Definition,Raster data is a grid of pixels where each grid square has a single attribute value,"Includes points, lines, or polygons"
Type,Image,
Generalization,Performs some simplification or generalizations based on average values within a square of the grid,
Resolution,"One grid cell equals one unit. Every cell has a value. A cell has a given resolution, given as the cell size in ground units (such as square meters). Depending on what the goal or purpose is of the map, higher resolution of a grid may or may not be necessary.",
Key Elements,Cell value; Cell size (resolution); Spatial reference (location information); Raster bands (stacking multiple grids of information),Points (single location); Lines (a set of connected points); Polygons (area marked by enclosing lines)
Saving,Saved as image files (.png or .tiff),
Common examples,Satellite images; Terrain maps; Land cover maps; elevation maps; disease incidence,Addresses (points); rivers or roads (lines); state or county jurisdiction (polygons)
Advantages,Simple data structure; easy overlay; various kinds of spatial analysis; uniform size and shape; cheaper technology,Good representation of reality; compact data structure; topology can be descrived in a network; accurate graphics
Disadvantages,Large amount of data; projection transformation is difficult; different scales between layers can be a nightmare; may lose information due to generalization,Complex data structures; simulation may be difficult; some spatial analysis is difficult
