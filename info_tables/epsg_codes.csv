Projection,EPSG,Projected,Optimizes,Distortion,Useage
WGS84,4326,-,-,-,"GPS, global datasets"
NAD83,4269,-,-,-,US-based GIS datasets
Albers Equal Area Conic,5070,X,area,shape and distance distorted slightly,"Thematic, demographic, environmental mapping"
Lambert Conformal Conic,102004,X,shape,area and distance distorted slightly,General cartography; maps that require shape accuracy
NAD83 / UTM + Zone,269<ZONE>; e.g.: 26911 for UTM Zone 11 North,X,local accuracy,distortion increases outside of each zone,"Large-scale maps (specific states, counties, cities, etc.)"
WGS84 / Mercator,3857,X,angles and shapes,distortion increases further from equator,global-scale mapping applications; navigation
WGS84 / Mercator,3395,X,angles and shapes,less distortion at mid-latitudes but still high near poles,"Web mapping for direction (used by Google Maps, OpenStreetMap)"
Web Mercator Auxiliary Sphere,3587,X,angles and shapes,similar to 3857 but used in some GIS systems,Used in ESRI and ArcGIS Online web mapping
NAD83/Montana,32100,X,area,,a good general purpose projection for the State of Montana; Albers Equal Area Conic projection; works best for mapping the entire state (wider east-west areas)
NAD83/Zone 11N,26911,X,areas between 120°W and 114°W,,optimizes area for Zone 11N; works best for narrower longitudincal bands (focuss on specific counties)
NAD83/Zone 12N,26912,X,areas between 114°W and 108°W,,optimizes area for Zone 12N; works best for narrower longitudincal bands (focuss on specific counties)
