# Critical Parts of a Map

There are three main types of maps: 

**General purpose map / Reference map / Base map**

* show general propoerties such as natural and human-made features
* e.g. administrative boundaries like states or countries, lakes, rivers, roads
   
**Thematic map / special-purpose or statistical map**

* illustrate the geographical distribution of a particular theme or phenomenon 
* e.g. climate, population density, health issues
* depicts the distribution of a chosen variable (s)
* can be qualitative (e.g. soil type, land cover, political districts)
* or can be or quantitative (e.g. income, population, disease rate, average temperature)
* mostly concerned with how things are distributed through space and/or time
* major sub-types include **choropleth and cartogram** maps
 
**Cartometric / Specialized map**

* designed and used for making accurate measurements
* e.g. USGS topographic maps, surveying maps

**Maps are not always necessary**
Is the most important message intrinsically spatially related? Are there other, perhaps more effective, ways to communicate your message? If you decide a map is the best way forward:

----------

## Before making your map: 

**1. Identify your purpose and goals**

* What do you want to convey?
* How accurate does the map need to be?
  + e.g. Is the map intended for precise navigation and surveying? Or, 
  + Is the map instead only intended to portray a spatial trend? 
  
 
**2. Define the scale**

* This ties into the purpose above regarding the question: how accurate does this need to be?
* Is this a map intended to display a large area (such as an entire country or state)? = "small scale map" 
* Or is this map intended to highlight a much more specific area, like a neighborhood? = "large scale map"

**NOTE:** the required scale of your map will also help you determine the best coordinate reference system and/or projection. 

**3. Identify your audience**

Will the map be used for an ordinary person? 
* Less is more. 
   
Is the map intended for a more specific, technical audience? 
* More detail might be helpful. 


**4. Identify the real-world features that you need to show**

**5. Choose how to represent those features**

* First we need to decide the type of map that best suits our purpose and audience
* Then we need to understand how brains typically process visual information
* Consider the elements that we want people to notice first 
* What do we want them to remember the most after looking at the map? 
* This will inform our **visual hierarchy**

**6. Apply projection and spatial referencing systems** 
*(discussed in previous chapters: see here and here for choosing the best CRS)*

**7. Classify and color any data appropriately for your map's purpose**

**8. Finalize and annotate the map**

## Map Elements

#### North arrow {.unnumbered} 
Usually the top part of the map represents the North orientation. It is still important to include a clear North arrow to indicate the orientation. It is also important to make sure that the north arrow is not too large, prominent, or elaborated, as this may distract the viewer's attention from the map content.

Another way to show location and orientation is by portraying **graticules** (lines of latitude and logitude). Using graticules is particularly helpful when there is an ambiguity about the direction of North. The graticules can help to clarify spatial orientation. It serves as a directional indicator and should complement the map content. Similar to the North arrow design, you should be mindful that graticules are not too prominent or complicated and that they doe not compete with the map content. 


#### Scale {.unnumbered}
**There are three ways to convey the scale of your map:**

* **Ratio:** 1:1000
* **Sentence/word:** One centimeter represents 1000 meters
* **Graphic:**
  + ![Graphic Scale](_images/scale.png){.lightbox width=25%}

**Best practice:** Always include the graphic scale bar. Never a bad idea to also include a sentence. 


#### Title {.unnumbered}

All maps must have a title that clearly and concisely explain the purpose of the map. The title is the first element that catches a viewer's eye. Care should be taken to most effectively represent the intent of the map with the title text. 

**The title design should include/be:** 

* placed at the top / top-center or directly above the legend
* large font 
* limited to one line if possible
* no need to tell people it's a map
* easily identifiable as a title of the map
* include descriptive text about the location and purpose of the map
* theme should be included if necessary

#### Legend {.unnumbered}

The legend explains the meaning of all map symbols. 

**A legend of a map should include/be:**

* placed within a white space of the map 
* title for the legend 
* do not need to explicitly state the word 'legend' 
* should not obstruct any other map elements
* legend symbols exactly match how they appear on the map
* items ordered logically
* symbols representing map features placed to the left of the explanatory text 


**Labels**

Labels play a vital role in highlighting significant elements of a map. 
By using diverse colors, types, sizes, and spacing, we can differentiate and distinguish the map content effectively. 

**Inset map**

Inset maps can be very helpful in providing additional information or context for the location and scale of the main map. It is essentially a secondary map area that displays the relation to a larger map area. 

Inset maps are also used to show areas that are related to the primary map, but are located at far off locations. For example, often maps of Alaska and Hawaii are included as insets to a map of the contiguous United States.


**Neatlines and Framelines**

Fancy words for a **border.** Both frame lines and neatlines are typically thin and black line boxes. If you find they are helpful or necessary, always maintain an equal distance between the map and all borders.

**Neatlines** are boarding boxs that surround map elements such as the title, legend, text boxes, etc. 

**Framelines** refer to a border around the entire map. Use a neatline especially if there is limited contrast between the map and the background of the page.


**Map Credits**
It is always important to credit the source of the data that you use. Generally the credits are dispalyed with fairly small text at the bottom of a map - use simple font to display this information (serif fonts are much harder to read when they are small).

Credit should include: 
 - source of spatial and attribute data
 - information on data processessing 
 - date of map creation and publication
 - applicable dates to the data visualized in the map
 - Projection of the map


**Illustrations** are almost never helpful and should not be used. 
On old maps, it's common to see elements or illustrations of sea creatures, sea monsters, and waves within water bodies. However, such illustrations are not common in modern maps. Illustrations create clutter and distract from the map's content. <span class = "highlight"> Always aim for simplicity </span> -  with only the necessary elements that help communicate the primary aim of the map.


**Typography/Text**

Typography can be found in multiple places and throughout all the elements on the map, such as titles, headings, captions, legends and labels. Different typefaces, sizes and spacing can convey the messages more effectively. For example, the use of bold letters can result in more pronounced effects depending on the map. The use of **sans font** is recommended over serif font. 

Typography includes decisions around: 
  - establishing visual hierarchy of elements
  - Color
  - Typeface
  - Size
  - Spacing
  - Style (bold, italic)

Typography can: 

 - Help establish visual hierarchy
 - Classify attributes
 
**Typography best practices:**  
 - Use one single typeface / font throughout the map
 - Use a single color
 - Use a single style
 - **UNLESS** you want to create visual hierarchy 
 - Sans type > Serif type
