# Color and Cartography

While color is certainly not the only visual tool or varialbe we have to try to communicate insights on a map (see visual hierarchy image here), it is certainly a major one that is used very often. 

Back in the day, color was used judiciously because maps had to be printed. And it
was quite expensive. And further back actually, color had to be added by hand to
maps. Then, in the 1980s... bam 💥... we got these cheap color printers...and suddenly we had
the ability to print colored maps.

We also moved into this age more recently where we are not printing as much, as more and more people 
gained access to and rely more on relatively cheap, high-quality computer monitors and other devices (tablets, smartphones, etc.) that display color very well.

We see color because of the reflection of electromagnetic radiation in a small
range of wavelengths. For example, a banana itself isn't inherently yellow. We see
it is yellow because the banana absorbs all other wavelengths and reflects the
wavelength that we perceive as yellow-- so kind of interesting to think about. And
then, white light is a mixture of all of the wavelengths.

On printed maps, the dies on those maps selectively absorb components of white
light. And so it sucks up those colors and reflects back light that we perceive as
whatever color we are seeing on the map. 

The opposite is true for monitors and televisions. Monitors and televisions actually emit 
electromagnetic radiation in red, green, and blue parts of the spectrum, and that's how 
we end up seeing the light from them.

## Three dimensions of color: Hue, Saturation, Value {.unnumbered}

Map makers can manipulate all three of these dimensions on maps to convey
different messages. 

When choosing how to display color and which dimensions of color to utilize, always consider: 

* Will people with colorblindness be able to interpret your map?

* Are you displaying different categorical variables, or differences in intensity of quantitative data?

* What may people interpret or associate with your color choices? e.g. bright reds and oranges are often associated with a subjective view of something "bad." 

* Is the use of color critical to understanding or interpretting the map? Could we consider using a consistent grey scale instead?

**HUE** is what most people think of as color. Hue is what is related to the
wavelength on the electromagnetic spectrum. In other words: moving from orange, to
yellow, to green, to blue, to indigo, etc. 

**VALUE**  is related to light versus dark. It applies to hues, as well as shades of gray. 

**SATURATION**, sometimes called "chroma", refers to the intensity of a color. 
**Gray tones do not have saturation.** So down here, on the left, you're seeing
this purple rectangle that's showing movement from this very light, not intense
purple, all the way to the high end, a very intense purple color.

People are generally better at differentiating between levels of **saturation** than between hues. 

So here on the right, you see hue value in saturation. Just presented, again, the four
hues across the top, then, four levels of color value, and then four gradations of
saturation on the bottom row. So generally, humans are better at differentiating
between levels of saturation than between hues. And so it's a good thing to keep in
mind when you're creating a map. There's also the fact that a lot of us associate
various things with different hues. And that's somewhat less the case with levels of
saturation.


## Using Color in Maps {.unnumbered}

* Use **saturation** for differences in **intensity** : best for **quantitative** data

    + our perceptions of color rank are subjective, and can often fail at ranking colors in the correct order
    + For example, in a map that uses a scale of greens to yellows to oranges to reds to show intensity from least to greatest, respectively: one person might initially view the yellow a being the highest, while another person might associate red with being the highest. 
    + This color scale would also be impossible for someone who is red-green colorblind to interpret

* Use **hue** for differences in category: best for **qualitative** data
